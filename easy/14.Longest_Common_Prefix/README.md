Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

__Constraints:__
1. `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
2. `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
3. `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
