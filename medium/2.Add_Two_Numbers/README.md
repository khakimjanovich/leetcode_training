## Add Two Numbers

You are given two __non-empty__ linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in __reverse order__, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

__Constraints:__

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
